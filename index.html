<h1>Guess that key!</h1>
<p>If you have ever used a screen reader with speech synthesis in multiple
   languages, you likely know the ugly bug that usually, key labels and certain
   user interface elements are not translated to the current synthesizer
   language.  We've made a game out of this to demonstrate that it is actually
   hilarious behaviour to implement in the 21st century.</p>
<p>You are a german screen reader user having temporarily switched to an english
   voice.  Can you guess what is actually being said?</p>
<p>A keyboard is (currently) required to play this game.</p>
<p>If you are using a screen reader, make sure to turn virtual mode off such that
   simple keypresses are not interpreted by your screen reader.<p>
<p>If you hear a key name, press it as fast as possible.</p>
<p>If you react in time, you win a point, if not, you loose one.  If your guess
   was incorrect, you loose two points.  With every round, timeout will be shorter.</p>
