Guess the key!
==============

A game to demonstrate what speech synthesis users need to cope with in the 21st century
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Guess the key` is a fun little browser game to demonstrate what blind
and low vision people have to cope with if they are using speech synthesis
in the 21st century and are working in a multilingual environment.

For some (to me completely strange) reason, almost all commercial and free
implementations of screen readers will not switch the description of
all keys if you decide to switch to a foreign language temporarily.
However, since the speech synthesis language was just changed, the
speech synthesizer will try to say a word from a (to it) foreign
language.  This is a fact since I can think, and I have always wondered
why it has to feel so terribly broken.  It would be simple to
implement it right, but for some reason, almost all screen
readers prefer to speak words with a terrible accent, instead of
translating the messages in question into the correct language.

Note that this is only true for labels of keys and certain
user interface elements.

Current functionality
---------------------

To start, we have just bound all the keys we have sound files for,
so you can hear the sounds and check if the mapping on your
keyboard is correct.

The game
--------

The game is played from the perspective of a german speech user just
having switched to english temporarily to read a website.

Once you hear the name of a key, press it as fast as possible.
If you guessed it correctly, you will earn points.
If you didn't, you will loose points.

Our natural voice Angela
------------------------

The sounds have been kindly contributed by Angela Engel.
She is enough of a long term screen reader users to have acquired
a natural understanding of how wrong it needs to be.

This also demonstrates the main point of this experiment.
This bug is so omnipresent that people actually *learn* the
wrong pronounciations by heart.  This game will continue to provide
the fun factor of hearing these sounds, but the wrong pronounciations
themselves in screen readers need to go!  We are in 21st century after all!
